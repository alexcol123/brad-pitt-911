                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                    William Bradley "Brad" Pitt was born on December 18, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to William Alvin Pitt, 
                    a trucking company proprietor, and Jane Etta (n√©e Hillhouse), a school counselor. He and his family moved 
                    away when he was a baby, and he grew up in Springfield, Missouri.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brad was raised in a conservative household and had a typical Midwestern upbringing. He was involved in 
                    sports, debates, and student government during his school years. He showed early interest in acting and 
                    participated in school plays and musicals.

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                    Pitt attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism with a focus on advertising. 
                    He was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity and involved in various campus activities. However, just 
                    shy of graduation in the mid-1980s, he made a life-changing decision to leave for California to pursue 
                    his dream of becoming an actor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This bold move represented a significant turning point in his life, as he left behind the security of 
                    his Missouri roots to chase his Hollywood dreams.

                    restaurant chain El Pollo Loco.

                    His first acting roles were small parts in television shows and B-movies in the late 1980s. 
                    He appeared in shows like "Dallas," "21 Jump Street," and "Growing Pains." These early experiences
