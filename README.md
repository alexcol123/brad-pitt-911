# Content Creation Workflow

## Overview
This project folder is designed for a systematic content creation process that transforms ideas into polished final drafts.

## Folder Structure

### 📁 ideas/
- Contains raw ideas in text files or any other format
- Simple, unstructured thoughts and concepts
- No specific format required - just capture the core idea

### 📁 examples/
- High-quality reference materials that define the desired style and tone
- Examples should represent the target quality, format, and voice for final outputs
- These serve as templates for content creation

### 📁 final drafts/
- Polished, completed content pieces
- Created by combining ideas with research and styling based on examples

## Content Creation Process

When asked to create content, always follow this workflow:

1. **Read the idea** - Review the relevant file in the `ideas/` folder
2. **Study the examples** - Analyze files in the `examples/` folder to understand:
   - Writing style and tone
   - Structure and format
   - Level of detail and depth
   - Target audience approach
3. **Research as needed** - Gather additional information to support the idea
4. **Create final draft** - Combine the idea with research, written in the style and tone demonstrated by the examples
5. **Save to final drafts** - Place the completed content in the `final drafts/` folder

## Key Principles
- Always maintain consistency with the style shown in examples
- Ensure final drafts are well-researched and comprehensive
- Match the tone, format, and quality level of the example materials
- Each final draft should be a polished, professional piece ready for use
