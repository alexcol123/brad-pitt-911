                    Brad Pitt's personal life has been subject to intense media scrutiny, particularly his marriages

                <h2>Marriage to Jennifer Aniston (2000-2005)</h2>
                <p>
                    Brad Pitt married actress Jennifer Aniston on July 29, 2000, in a lavish ceremony in Malibu, California. 
                    The couple was considered one of Hollywood's golden pairs and were frequently in the spotlight during 
                    their marriage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During their marriage, they co-founded Plan B Entertainment in 2001, initially as a joint venture 
                    with producer Brad Grey. The couple announced their separation in January 2005, and their divorce 
                    was finalized in October 2005. Their split was highly publicized, especially in relation to Pitt's 
                    subsequent relationship with Angelina Jolie.

                <h2>Relationship and Marriage to Angelina Jolie (2005-2016)</h2>
                <p>
                    Brad Pitt began a relationship with actress Angelina Jolie after they met on the set of "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" 
                    in 2005. The couple, dubbed "Brangelina" by the media, became one of the most photographed and talked-about 
                    couples in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Together, they raised six children - three adopted (Maddox, Pax, and Zahara) and three biological 
                    (Shiloh, and twins Knox and Vivienne). The couple married in August 2014 at their French estate, 
                    Château Miraval, in a private ceremony.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In September 2016, Jolie filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce proceedings 
                    were lengthy and often contentious, involving custody disputes over their children. After an eight-year 
                    legal battle, their divorce was finally finalized in 2024.

                    a central part of his life. The custody arrangements following his divorce from Jolie have been
