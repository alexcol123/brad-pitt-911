                <p>
                    Plan B Entertainment is an American production company founded in November 2001 by Brad Pitt, 
                    Brad Grey, Kristin Hahn, and Jennifer Aniston. After Pitt and Aniston's divorce in 2005 and 
                    Grey's departure to become CEO of Paramount Pictures, Brad Pitt became the sole owner of the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The company is currently led by Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner as co-presidents, alongside Pitt. 
                    Plan B has established itself as one of Hollywood's most successful independent production companies, 
                    known for producing socially conscious, critically acclaimed films and television series.

                <p>
                    In a major business development, Plan B Entertainment was sold to French media conglomerate Mediawan 
                    in 2024. Mediawan acquired a majority stake in Plan B in a deal reportedly valued in the low hundreds 
                    of millions of dollars. Brad Pitt retained a minority stake in the company, ensuring his continued 
                    involvement while providing resources for expansion.
