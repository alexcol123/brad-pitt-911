                <p>
                    Brad Pitt's Formula One racing drama "F1," directed by Joseph Kosinski, has become his highest-grossing 
                    film to date, earning nearly $600 million worldwide and surpassing "World War Z" ($540 million). 
                    The film features Pitt as an aging Formula One race car driver who returns to competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pitt reportedly earned $30 million for the film, which was shot in collaboration with actual Formula One 
                    races for authentic racing sequences. The film's success has solidified Pitt's continued box office appeal 
                    well into his 60s.

                <h2>Wolfs (2024) - Reunion with George Clooney</h2>
                <p>
                    In September 2024, Brad Pitt reunited with longtime friend George Clooney for "Wolfs," an action-comedy 
                    thriller written and directed by Jon Watts. The film features the duo as rival fixers who are forced 
                    to work together on the same job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reunion marked another successful collaboration between the two stars, who have maintained a close 
                    friendship since their "Ocean's" trilogy days. Their on-screen chemistry and comedic timing were 
                    praised by critics and audiences alike.

                <h2>Divorce Finalized (2024)</h2>
                <p>
                    After an eight-year legal battle, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's divorce was finally finalized in 2024. 
                    The lengthy proceedings involved complex custody arrangements for their six children and the division 
                    of assets, including their French vineyard Château Miraval.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The conclusion of this high-profile divorce allows Pitt to move forward with his personal life while 
                    continuing to co-parent their children. The resolution removes a significant source of media attention 
                    that had followed him for nearly a decade.

                <h2>Plan B Entertainment Sale to Mediawan</h2>
                <p>
                    In a major business development, Brad Pitt's production company Plan B Entertainment was sold to 
                    French media conglomerate Mediawan in 2024. The deal, reportedly valued in the low hundreds of 
                    millions of dollars, sees Mediawan acquire a majority stake while Pitt retains a minority ownership.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This strategic partnership provides Plan B with additional resources for expansion while maintaining 
                    Pitt's creative involvement. The company continues to be led by co-presidents Dede Gardner and 
                    Jeremy Kleiner alongside Pitt.
