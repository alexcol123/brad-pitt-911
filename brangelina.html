                <h2>The Beginning: Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005)</h2>
                <p>
                    Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie first met on the set of "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" in early 2004, where they 
                    played married spies who discover they've been assigned to kill each other. At the time, Pitt was 
                    married to Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie had recently ended her marriage to Billy Bob Thornton.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chemistry between Pitt and Jolie was undeniable both on and off screen. While both stars initially 
                    denied any romantic involvement during filming, their relationship became public after Pitt's separation 
                    from Aniston was announced in January 2005. The timing of their relationship sparked intense media 
                    speculation and controversy.

                <h2>Early Relationship & Public Debut (2005-2006)</h2>
                <p>
                    In April 2005, paparazzi photos surfaced of Pitt, Jolie, and her son Maddox vacationing together in 
                    Kenya, effectively confirming their relationship. The couple became instant tabloid fodder, with the 
                    media dubbing them "Brangelina."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their first major public appearance as a couple came in January 2006 when they were photographed 
                    together in Ethiopia, where Jolie was filming "Beyond Borders." The couple's relationship was 
                    characterized from the beginning by their shared commitment to humanitarian causes and international 
                    adoption.

                <h2>Building a Family Together</h2>
                
                <h3>The Adoptions</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the defining aspects of Brangelina was their commitment to building a diverse, international family:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Maddox Chivan</strong> (born 2001) - Originally adopted by Jolie from Cambodia in 2002, Pitt legally adopted him in 2006</li>
                    <li><strong>Zahara Marley</strong> (born 2005) - Adopted from Ethiopia in July 2005, with Pitt co-adopting in 2006</li>
                    <li><strong>Pax Thien</strong> (born 2003) - Adopted from Vietnam in March 2007</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Biological Children</h3>
                <p>
                    The couple also had three biological children together:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shiloh Nouvel</strong> (born May 27, 2006) - Their first biological child, born in Swakopmund, Namibia</li>
                    <li><strong>Knox Léon and Vivienne Marcheline</strong> (born July 12, 2008) - Twins born in Nice, France</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The birth of Shiloh made international headlines, with the first photos selling for $4.1 million to 
                    People magazine and Hello! magazine, with proceeds donated to charity. Similarly, the first photos 
                    of twins Knox and Vivienne sold for $14 million, the most expensive celebrity baby photos ever taken.

                <h2>The Golden Years (2006-2012)</h2>
                <p>
                    During their peak years as a couple, Brangelina became one of the most photographed and influential 
                    couples in the world. They were known for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Red Carpet Power</strong> - Their appearances at premieres and award shows were major media events</li>
                    <li><strong>Humanitarian Work</strong> - Joint efforts in disaster relief, refugee advocacy, and international aid</li>
                    <li><strong>Real Estate Empire</strong> - Properties around the world including Château Miraval in France</li>
                    <li><strong>Professional Collaborations</strong> - Jolie directed Pitt in "By the Sea" (2015)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The couple established the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, which made significant donations to humanitarian 
                    causes worldwide. They were particularly active in refugee advocacy, with Jolie serving as a UN 
                    Goodwill Ambassador and later Special Envoy.

                <h2>The Wedding: Château Miraval (August 23, 2014)</h2>
                <p>
                    After nearly nine years together and six children, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie finally married on 
                    August 23, 2014, at their estate Château Miraval in Correns, France. The intimate ceremony was 
                    attended by their children and just 20 close friends and family members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The couple had previously stated they wouldn't marry until marriage equality was legal everywhere, 
                    but eventually decided to wed for their children's sake. Jolie wore a custom Versace gown decorated 
                    with drawings made by their children, symbolizing their family's central role in their relationship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their wedding was kept secret from the media and only confirmed days later, marking a rare moment 
                    of privacy for the highly public couple.

                <h3>By the Sea (2015)</h3>
                <p>
                    The couple's final professional collaboration came with "By the Sea," a drama written and directed 
                    by Angelina Jolie starring both actors. The film, about a troubled marriage, was shot in Malta and 
                    marked their first on-screen appearance together since "Mr. & Mrs. Smith."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ironically, the film's themes of marital discord would prove prophetic, as the couple announced 
                    their separation just a year after its release.
                </p>

                <h3>Through Plan B Entertainment</h3>
                <p>
                    While not directly collaborating, Jolie was involved in some Plan B Entertainment projects during 
                    their relationship, including humanitarian documentaries and socially conscious films that aligned 
                    with both of their values.

                <p>
                    Signs of trouble in the Brangelina marriage began to surface in 2015-2016. The couple appeared 
                    less frequently together at public events, and there were reports of tension during the filming 
                    of "By the Sea."
                </p>
                <p>
                    On September 15, 2016, an incident occurred on a private jet that would become central to their 
                    divorce proceedings. According to reports, an altercation took place between Pitt and Maddox, 
                    with allegations that Pitt was intoxicated and became physical with their eldest son.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just days later, on September 19, 2016, Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, citing 
                    irreconcilable differences and requesting sole physical custody of their six children. The filing 
                    sent shockwaves through Hollywood and marked the end of one of the entertainment industry's most 
                    powerful couples.

                <h3>Initial Proceedings and Investigations</h3>
                <p>
                    Following Jolie's divorce filing, the FBI and Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family 
                    Services investigated the plane incident. Both agencies ultimately cleared Pitt of any wrongdoing, 
                    but the incident remained a source of contention throughout the divorce proceedings.

                <h3>Custody Disputes</h3>
                <p>
                    The most contentious aspect of their divorce involved custody of their children. Key developments included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>2016-2018</strong> - Initial custody arrangements with supervised visits for Pitt</li>
                    <li><strong>2018-2021</strong> - Gradual increase in Pitt's custody time and unsupervised visits</li>
                    <li><strong>2021</strong> - Temporary custody ruling granting Pitt more time with younger children</li>
                    <li><strong>Maddox's choice</strong> - As the eldest child reached 18, he testified and chose limited contact with Pitt</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Property and Financial Disputes</h3>
                <p>
                    The couple's extensive assets became another source of conflict:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Château Miraval</strong> - Ongoing legal battle over the French vineyard and estate</li>

                    in 2024. The resolution included:

                    The Brangelina story serves as both a fairy tale romance and a cautionary tale about fame, 
                    family, and the pressures of public life. Their 12-year relationship (2005-2016) was marked by 
                    genuine humanitarian efforts, a beautiful family, and significant cultural impact, but ultimately 
                    could not withstand the pressures of their celebrity status and personal differences.

                    Their story continues to evolve as they co-parent their children and pursue separate lives, 
                    serving as a reminder that even Hollywood's most glamorous relationships face real-world challenges 
                    that money and fame cannot solve.
